## Introduction

This is my Simple Password Generator. I know, there are tons of these out there, but I built this one as a fun way to learn **Ruby on Rails**.

It's my first time using the framework, and I wanted to share what I've created.

## Features

- Set your own password length.
- Your settings are saved, so it's easy to make more passwords (session).
- Option to include special signs.
- Option to include numbers.

## Tech Stuff

- Built with Ruby on Rails.
- Runs in Docker, deployed on a VPS, and uses NGINX as the reverse proxy.

That's it! :)
